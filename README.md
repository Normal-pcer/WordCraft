# WordCraft
Text version _Minecraft_ written in Python.

It abstracts elements in _Minecraft_ (such as blocks, entities, etc.) into Chinese Characters, and allows user to play with mouse and keyboard normally.

## Installation
I'll provide executable files in future versions, but for now, you can install it by running source code.

1. Install Python 3. You can download it from [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Start terminal and run `python3 main.py` in the root directory.

## Control
- Use A and D to move left and right.
- Use space to jump.
- Use mouse to check a block, and click to break it.

## Plans
- Realize basic game logic.
- Add more blocks.
- Add entities.

## Contribution
You can contribute via start issues and pull requests.
